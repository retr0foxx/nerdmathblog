        <h1>Brainstorms regarding polytopes</h1>
        Here are the questions that I had while brainstorming about polytopes: <br>
        1. How do you define and "construct" higher dimensional polytopes? <br>
        2. Point-collision of higher dimensional polytopes <br>
        3. Volume of higher dimensional polytopes
        <br><br>
        I have noticed that in my attempt to formalize these notions, I still lack a lot of tools from Linear Algebra and Analysis that are in the books that I have but simply haven't read because I haven't reached the chapters for them.
        The strategy is to define the following: <br>
        <b>Definition</b>: "closed-continuous-body" in a vector space V under F to be a set $C$ which satisfies: <br>
        1. For any two vectors $v_1,\ v_2$ in C, there exist a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \to C$ such that $f(0) = v_1$ and $f(1) = v_2$ and $\forall r \in [0, 1]$, $f(r) \in C$ <br> 
        2. $\forall v \in V,\ c \in C$ where $v$ is not the additive identity of $V$, there exists $\lambda \in F$ such that $\lambda c = O$ satisfies $O \in C$ and $\forall \epsilon \geq 0$, $O + \epsilon v \notin C$ <br>
        The issue is that I still haven't properly studied what it means for a function vector-valued function like that to be continuous and maybe the details of what the range and image of a continuous function must satisfy.
        I'm imagining that we can define what it means for a function from $R$ to a euclidean vector space BECAUSE there exists the concept of "distance," but not all vector spaces may have that.
        Here's my attempt at writing what it means for a function to be continuous: <br>
        <b>Definition</b>: A metric set $A$ to be a set with a distance function $d_A: A \to \mathbb{R}$ which satisfies $d_A(a, b) \geq 0$, $d_A(a, b) = d_A(b, a)$, $d_A(a, a) = 0$, and $d_A(a, b) \leq d_A(a, c) + d_A(b, c)$ <br>
        <b>Definition</b>: A function $f: A \to B$ from a measurable set A and B is continuous at $a \in A$ if and only if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for every $x \in A$ where $d_A(a, x) < \delta$ implies $d_A(f(a), f(x)) < \epsilon$ <br>
        Yeah I kinda cheated there, I researched the definition of continuity and metric spaces, I learned something new anyway though that's all that matters.
        <br><br>
        Next is to define the concept of the affine space $A$ of a set of vectors $C$ in the vector space $V$ to be the set of all vectors $v$ that satisfies:
        $\exists k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\exists O, u_1, ..., u_k \in C$ where $\exists \lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k$ which satisfies $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i (u_i - O) = v - O$
        <br><br>
        <!-- I will attempt to explain what I mean by starting from the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional case.
        In 2-dimensions, you can define a polygon using a list of points arranged in a certain order.
        Then you can visually think of the polygon in terms of it's line-segment boundaries where each line-segment is defined by each adjacent pair of points in the list. 
        And that method seem like the most natural way to represent them.
        However with the way I'm gonna explain it right now, it is a bit different for the purpose of ease of generalization. -->
        <!-- A point-extension operation is an operation which generally takes a polytope and a face of the polytope, and a point as parameters for the operation, and creates a new polytope based on them.
        There are two undefined words there: dimension and face.
        Define a polytope as a set F of euclidean vectors that can be defined in the steps defined later.
        A polytope is N-dimensional if you can find a list of N+1 vectors inside of the polytope such that, if you take an element K in the list and the sublist that does not contain K denoted S, the list of vectors made from every element of S substracted by K is linearly independent and it's span contains every element in F substracted by K.
        In other words, a polytope is N-dimensional if $\exists L = v_1, ..., v_{n+1}$ s.t. $\forall k \in {1, ..., n + 1}$, $S = L \backslash v_{k} - v_{k}$, where the substraction substracts every element of $L \backslash v_k$ by $v_k$, is linearly independent and $\forall f \in F$, $f - v_k \in \text{span}(S)$.
        Now to define the "face" of a polytope. This is an interesting problem in-itself and I'm actually not sure yet on how to do that.
        I will only define the intuitive definition of a face which is just a boundary of a polytope which itself is a polytope that is contained inside of the polytope that it's a face of.
        An N-dimensional polytope has faces of dimensions 1 to N-1.
        A 0-dimensional face is a point, a 1-dimensional face is a line, a 2-dimensional face is a plane, and so on.
        A cube has eight 0-dimensional faces, twelve 1-dimensional faces, and six 2-dimensional faces.
        I will also define the affine space of a polytope F as being the set of all vectors that, if substracted by any vector V in the polytope, it can be made by a linear combination of a list of vectors in the polytope added by V.
        In other words, the set of all vectors $A$ where there exists $k \in N$ such that there exists $O, v_1, ..., v_k \in F$, $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(v_i - O) = A$
        <br><br>
        There are two types of point extensions, one that increases the dimension of the polytope and one that keeps it the same.
        A point-extension with point P that increases the dimension of the current polytope does not need a face parameter.
        Because the entirety of the current existing polytope will become one of the face of the extended polygon.
        An extension with the point P does not increase the dimension of the polytope if and only if P is in the affine space of the polytope.
        <br><br>
        If F is the original polygon and G is the polygon made from extending F to the point P with the face polygon K (which may only be F itself if P is not in the affine space of F),
        then it is defined the "extension polygon" of the extension to be a polygon E
        where $V \in E$ is true if and only if $\exists \lambda \in \mathbb{R}, R \in F$ such that $P + \lambda(R - P) = V$.
        <br><br>
        Now to define the steps to make a polygon. -->
        <b>Definition</b>: A boundary point P of a closed-continuous-body B is a vector such that there exists a non-zero vector $v$ such that for any $\lambda > 0$, $\lambda v + P \notin B$ <br>
        <b>Definition</b>: The dimension of a closed-continuous-body B is the length of the largest linearly-independent list of vectors $v_1 - O, ..., v_k - O$ where $O, v_1, ..., v_k \in B$ <br>
        <b>Definition</b>: A point-dilation-extension of a set of vectors S onto the point P is the set of vectors where each vector $v$ in the set satisfies $\exists \lambda \in \mathbb{R} > 0, R \in S$ such that $P + \lambda(R - P) = V$. <br>
        <b>Definition</b>: A polytope is a closed-continuous-body that satisfies certain properties
        <br><br>
        Now we're getting into the main problem: How do we formalize the properties that a polytope must have?
        Here are the list of ideas that I had: <br>
        1. Formalize the type of boundaries that a polytope has. We can intuitively see that something is a polytope from it's boundaries.
        The idea is to define the concept of faces and their dimensions and that polytopes of dimensions N have atleast 1 face of every dimension less than N, but there must also always be a finite amount of faces of each dimension.
        The faces themselves have to be polytopes and we know intuitively that they somehow look "flat and linear" in 3-dimensions so maybe the definitiono of these faces may have something related to that.
        So the big idea is to define what it means for a closed-continuous-body to be a polytope by checking if it satisfies the condition that it has these types of faces<br>
        2. Create an algorithm that centers around point-dilation-extensions. The idea is that something is a polytope if and only if it can be constructed using this algorithm. <br>
        3. The concept that I'm the most unsure about, do it using a list of steps where, on each ith step, it establishes all of the i-dimensional faces of the shape.

        <br><br>

        <br><br><br>
        notes:
        N-dimensional-surrounding point in S, a point in a set S where there's an N-dimensional ball centered at the point that is a subset of the set <br>
        a point P in a set S where all directions that you can move in to keep yourself in S spans an N dimensional vector space is called an N-dimensional-go-point i cannot name things oMG <br>
        everything in a convex and concave polytope of dimension N is an N-dimensional-go-point but not intersecting ones.
        or atleast theres a simple example in the 1d case. is that meaningful? find an example in the higher dimensional cases! <br>
