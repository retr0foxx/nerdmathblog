        <h1>All real numbers have a decimal representation</h1>
        <p>The goal here is to prove that every real number have a decimal representation. A decimal representation of a real number r is defined as a sequence $r_n$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} r_i10^i = r$.
        <br>The strategy for the proof is to start with any number $a$, and then create a decimal representation and prove that the decimal representation actually represents $a$. It is obvious that if you can have a decimal representation of a positive number, then you can have a decimal representation of any negative numbers. Therefore, the first step of the proof will only prove the positive case.
        The first step is to define $r_n$, $p_n$, and $d_n$ for every natural number n. $r_1$ is defined to be $r_1 = |a|$, then $r_{n+1} = r_n - d_n10^{p_n}$, while the rest of the variables is defined as:
        $$
        p_n = \begin {cases}
            -\infty, & r_n = 0 \\
            \max \{p | p \in \mathbb{Z} \land 10^p \leq r_n\}, & r_n \neq 0
        \end {cases}
        $$
        $$
        d_n = \begin{cases}
            0, & r_n = 0 \\
            \max \{d | d \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\} \land d \cdot 10^{p_n} \leq r_n \}, & r_n \neq 0
        \end{cases}
        $$
        The next step is to prove that these steps work. Which is needed because both of these might take the maximum of a set and that does not always exist. First is to prove that there, for any real number, there is a power of 10 less than it:
        <br>
        $\forall \epsilon > 0$ $\exists n \in \mathbb{N}: \frac{1}{n} \leq \epsilon$ by the Archimedean property $\implies \frac{1}{10^n} < \frac{1}{n} \leq {\epsilon} \land \frac{1}{10^n} = 10^{-n} \implies \forall \epsilon > 0$ $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}: 10^n \leq \epsilon$ 
        <br>
        Next is to prove $r_n \geq 0$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ by using induction:
        <br>
        1. $r_1 \geq 0.$ <br>
        2. $r_n \geq 0 \implies r_n = 0 \lor r_n > 0$<br>
        2. a. $r_n = 0 \implies d_n = 0 \implies r_{n + 1} = r_n - 0 \cdot 10^{p_m} = r_n - 0 = 0 - 0 = 0$ <br>
        2. b. $r_n > 0 \implies p_n = \max \{p | p \in \mathbb{Z} \land 10^p \leq r_n\} \implies p_n$ exists because that set is non-empty as we've proven earlier $ \implies 1 \in \{d | d \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\} \land d \cdot 10^{p_n} \leq r_n \} \implies d_n $ exists because there is atleast 1 element in the set in the definition of $d_n$ $\implies r_{n+1} = r_n - d_n10^{p_n} \geq 0$ by the definition of $d_n$ and $p_n$ when $r_n \geq 0$<br>
        2. a $\land$ b $\implies \left(r_n \geq 0 \implies r_{n+1} \geq 0 \right)$ <br>
        By induction, we can conclude that $r_n \geq 0$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Notice that we have also proved that $d_n$ and $p_n$ is always defined for all natural number n.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step is to create the sequence to represent $|a|$ to be:
            $$
            a_n = \begin{cases}
            d_{\min \{m | p_m = n\}}, & \text{if } n \in \{p_m | m \in \mathbb{N}\} \\
            0, & otherwise
            \end{cases}
            $$
            This works because $n \in \{p_m | m \in \mathbb{N}\} \implies \exists m \in \mathbb{N}: p_m = n \implies \{m | p_m = n\} \neq \emptyset \implies \min \{m | p_m = n\}$ exists.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so the next big step is to prove that $a_n$ really does represent $|a|$. The strategy is to first prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty} r_n = 0$, and then maybe that $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} d_i10^{p_i} = |a|$ which is an intuitive implication of the former.
            The first thing we'll do is to prove $\lim_{n \to \infty} r_n = 0$ which can be done by proving that $\forall \epsilon > 0$ $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}: \forall n > N, r_n < \epsilon$.
            The strategy to prove this is to first prove the implication $(r_m \neq 0 \implies r_{m + 1} < 10^{p_m})$
            <!-- The strategy for proving that is to prove that $r_{n+1} < 10^{p_n}$ which should imply that $p_{n + 1} < p_n$ so, whatever $p_1$ is, $p_k$ should be less than $p_1 - k + 2$ for any natural number k, and so for any integer, you can find a k such that $p_k$ is less than that integer. Anyway, here's the proof: <br>
            -->
        </p>
        <p>
            Take any $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $r_m \neq 0$ then we know that $d_m10^{p_m} \leq r_m$.
            From the definition of $d_m$, $d_m + 1$ satisfies $d_m + 1 \notin \{1, 2, ..., 9\} \lor (d_m + 1)10^{p_m} > r_m$.
            If it satisfies $d_m + 1 \notin \{1, 2, ..., 9\}$, then since $d_m \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\}$, then $d_m + 1$ must be 10
            $\implies (d_m + 1)10^{p_m} = 10^{p_m + 1}$ and based on the definition of $p_m$, it is known that $10^{p_m + 1} > r_m$
            $\implies (d_m + 1)10^{p_m} > r_m$. (Yeah, I really should've just defined it as d_m being natural and less than $d_m10^{p_m}$ and proved that instead, but whatever).
            Because of that, $d_m + 1$ always satisfies $(d_m + 1)10^{p_m} > r_m$. The reason can be described more generally to be $\left(\left(A \implies B \lor C\right) \land \left(B \implies C\right)\right) \implies \left(A \implies C\right)$. 
            Based on that, now we know that $d_m10^{p_m} \leq r_m < (d_m + 1)10^{p_m} \implies 0 \leq r_m - d_m10^{p_m} < 10^{p_m} \implies 0 \leq r_{m + 1} < 10^{p_m}$ <br>
            And there we go, we have proven that $r_{m + 1} \leq 10^{p_m}$ when $r_m \neq 0$.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step is to prove that the actual limit. Start with any $\epsilon > 0$, then $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $10^k < \epsilon$ which is something that has been proved earlier.
            Define j to be:
            $$
            j = \begin{cases}
            0, & \text{if } r_1 = 0 \\
            p_1 + 1, & \text{if } r_1 \neq 0
            \end{cases}
            $$
            Now we will be doing induction: <br>
            1. r_1 < 10^j$ <br>
            2. r_k < 10^{j - k + 1} \implies r_k = 0 \lor r_k > 0$ <br>
            2. a. $r_k = 0 \implies r_{k + 1} = 0 \implies r_{k + 1} < 10^{j - (k + 1) + 1}$ <br>
            2. b. $r_k > 0 \implies r_{k + 1} < 10^{p_k} < 10^{j - k + 1}$. Because $p_k,\ j - k + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ while $10^{p_k} < 10^{j - k + 1}$, then $p_k \leq j - (k + 1) + 1$ which means $r_{m + 1} < 10^{p_k} \leq 10^{j + (k - 1) + 1}$<br>
            2. It can be concluded that $r_k < 10^{j - k + 1} \implies r_{k + 1} < 10^{j - (k + 1) + 1}$ <br>
            Because we have covered k = 1 and the general case which states that if it's true for any k, then it is true for k + 1, then by induction, it can be concluded that $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$, $10^{p_k} < 10^{j - k + 1} \leq 10^j$ <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Go back to the $\epsilon$ from before, by what we have proved earlier, $\exists q \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $10^q < \epsilon$. Define 
            q either satisfies $q \leq j$ or $q > j$. If $q > j$, then $10^q > 10^j > r_1$ and we're done. Otherwise, $q \leq j \implies q - 1 < j \implies j - q + 1 > 0 \implies j - q + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ <br>
            $j - (j - (q - 1)) = j - j + q - 1 = q - 1 < q < j$ because $j - (q - 1) \in \mathbb{N}$ therefore $j - (j - (q - 1)) < j$ <br>
            Set $k = j - (q - 1)$ which means $j - k < q < j \land k \in \mathbb{N}$ therefore, based on the induction proof we did before, $r_k < 10^{j - k + 1} \leq 10^q < \epsilon$ <br>
            Therefore, we can conclude that $\forall \epsilon > 0\ \exists k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\epsilon > r_k$ <br>
            And remember that we have also proved earlier that $r_n \geq 0\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ therefore we can conclude that $\lim_{n \to \infty} r_n = 0$.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step is to prove that $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i} = |a|$.
            The strategy I'm thinking of is to first prove that $r_m = |a| - \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}$ 
            which would mean:
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \lim_{n \to \infty} r_n &= \lim_{n \to \infty} |a| - \sum_{i=1}^{n - 1} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}\\
            &= \lim_{n \to \infty} |a| - \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}\\
            &= |a| - \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}\\
            &= 0 \\
            |a| &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i} \\
            |a| &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}
            \end{align}
            $$
            Just to make things clear, since I'm also not very experienced in Real Analysis.
            I haven't reached the chapter for sequence limits on the book I'm reading so I'll be listing the assumptions made in there here:
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \lim_{n \to \infty} c - f(n) &= c - \lim_{n \to \infty} f(n) \tag{1} \\
            \lim_{n \to \infty} f(n - c) &= \lim_{n \to \infty} f(n) \tag{2} \\
            \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i) &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} f(i) \tag{3} \\
            \end{align}
            $$
            Given that c is a constant. The third assumption is more of a notational assumption though.
            Assumption 1 is used on step 3, assumption 2 is used on step 2, and assumption 3 is used on the last step.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now for the inductive proof that $r_m = |a| - \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}$ : <br>
            1. $r_1 = |a| = |a| - \sum_{i=1}^0$ <br>
            2. $r_n = |a| - \sum_{i=1}^{n - 1} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i} \land r_{n+1} = r_n - d_n \cdot 10^{p_n}$
            $\implies r_{n+1} = |a| - \sum_{i=1}^{n - 1} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i} - d_n \cdot 10^{p_n}$
            $= |a| - \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}$ <br>
            Therefore, by induction, you can conclude that $r_m = |a| - \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}$ $\forall m \in \mathbb{N}$ therefore $|a| = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} d_i \cdot 10^{p_i}$ based on the proof from earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now for the final step, which is to prove that $a_n$ really does represent $|a|$.
            Which is the same as proving that $\sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} a_i = |a|$.
            I have never seen a sum that starts from negative infinity up to positive infinity like this, so I am truthfully also kind of confused on what to do.
            The strategy is to first prove that all $i$s higher than than a certain integer doesn't matter.
            But with the way I did it, that would mean the sum would now be in the form $\sum_{i=-\infty}^{N}$ which is still really weird because you're starting from $-\infty$ but then you set the upper bound to a finite value.
            The problem is that I've never seen nor used this kind of notation. I know what I want this notation to do and I want it to do a very specific thing.
            If this notation is actually valid in math, then the interpretation that I specifically want in here might be wrong.
            I specifically want that sum to literally be the same as $\sum_{i=-N}^{\infty}$ while $i$ will be used as $-i$ inside.
            One possible way to define what is really meant by $\sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} a_i$ now is by using a bijective mapping $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ and change the sum to start from 1 to infinity while substituting any $i$ inside with $f(i)$.
            And the bijective mapping f is defined as the classic alternating $0, 1, -1, ...$ mapping.
            The issue is that, if I want to decrease the upper bound and make it a finite value, the resulting sum that is supposed to represent the same thing now becomes weird.
            Because you can't just change the upper bound, it's still an infinite sum, but now you're somehow excluding every odd/even terms.
            But I can simply NOT use the other representation of the sum. I can simply argue that this is what the completely unbounded sum really means.
            And in the end, I would still use the original representation. The other one just helps with what this completely unbounded sum really means.
            Yeah, I think that's fair enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start with whatever $p_1$ is. If $r_1$ is 0, then we have actually proved earlier that every other $r_n$ is also 0 which means $d_n$ is all 0.
            So the sum from earlier will just be summing over zeros which is just 0 so that's done.
            If $r_1$ is not zero, then start with whatever $p_1$ is, and prove that in the earlier sum, any $i$ that is higher than $p_1$ will be 0.
            This means you can change the form of the sum to something else.
            After that, you can prove that every term in the sum for |a| is in the sum for $a_n$ and vice versa, and there is only 1 of the "same" term in each.
