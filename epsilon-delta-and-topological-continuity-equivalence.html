id="epsilon-delta-definition-of-continuity-and-topological-definition-of-continuity-for-the-reals"><span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span> definition of continuity
and topological definition of continuity for the reals</h1>
<p>In this page, I will be talking about the <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span> definition and how it
relates to the topological definition of continuity specifically for the
real numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition 1 (<span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span> Continuity).</strong> A
function <span class="math inline">\(f: A \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span> is
continuous if, for all <span class="math inline">\(x_0 \in A\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> there exists a
<span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> such that for all
<span class="math inline">\(x \in (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta)\)</span>
it follows that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in (f(x_0) - \epsilon,
f(x_0) + \epsilon)\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition 2 (Topological Definition of Continuity).</strong>
Let <span class="math inline">\((X, \tau)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((Y, \mathcal{B})\)</span> be topological spaces,
then <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> is continuous if
for any <span class="math inline">\(B \subseteq Y\)</span> that is an
open set under the topology <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> it follows that the preimage
of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> denoted <span class="math inline">\(A =
f^{-1}(B)\)</span> is also open under the topology <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I want to tell yo u a story about this. One day, I wanted to
prove that the first definition implies the second definition. When I
was trying to do that, I got the reference for the second definition
from the automatic top results in a Google search. The issue with that
is that the definition Google gave me was not very rigorous which made
me forget about the fact that I need to care about the topologies when
talking about the pure topological definition. Here was the definition
Google gave</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> is continuous if the
pre-image of every open set in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is
open in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When trying to prove this, I forgot to actually think about the
topologies. I was thinking that if I wanted to prove that the <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon - \delta\)</span> definition implies the
topological definition, I would simply be proving that the pre-image of
every open intervals in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> (which
comes from the fact that every open set is the union of open intervals)
under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> such that every element in
the open interval has an element in the domain of the function which
corresponds to that element is strictly an open set which is NOT TRUE.
If that’s the case, then any function from the rationals to the reals is
discontinuous which is not necessarily true (I still thought it was
true, though) and that functions with only one possible input cannot be
continuous. Heck, by that definition, constant functions will not be
continuous since there is no open interval in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> which contains only one
element which is required for the part which says that “every element in
the open interval has an element in the domain of the function which
corresponds to that element in the open interval.”</p>
<p>A part (since most of it simply happened from sheer stupidity) of the
previous train of thought makes a tiny bit more sense when looking at my
actual misunderstanding. When you have a function <span
class="math inline">\(f : A \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span>, then if you’re
trying to describe it’s continuity using the topological definition of
continuity, you would have to describe the topology to use for <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This would mean that earlier, I was
thinking that you would always use the same topology that you would use
for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. The topology in
which open sets are the way we know them to be but that is not the case.
If it were the case, then the topological statement would imply that the
pre-image of every open interval in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is a strictly open set in
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>The right topology to use is something called the “subset topology”
or “relative topology” for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> which
is the topology in which open sets in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> denoted <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is defined as any set where there
exists an open set in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>
that you can intersect with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to be
strictly equal to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. More formally,
if <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, \tau)\)</span> is the
standard topological space for <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span>, then the relative
topology of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span> is denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{0} = \{ U \cap A | U \in \tau
\}\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is
the set of all rationals, then intuitively, you would want open sets in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> to be any set <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that for all <span
class="math inline">\(q_0 \in S\)</span> it follows that there exists an
<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> such that for any
<em>rational</em> <span class="math inline">\(q \in (q_0 - \epsilon, q_0
+ \epsilon)\)</span> it follows that <span class="math inline">\(q \in
S\)</span>.</p>
<p>This makes a lot of sense when going back to the <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon - \delta\)</span> definition of
continuity. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous
by the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon - \delta\)</span> definition
of limits. Then for any <span class="math inline">\(a \in A, \epsilon
&gt; 0\)</span>, there exists a <span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt;
0\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in (a -
\delta, a + \delta) \cap A\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \in (f(a) - \epsilon, f(a) +
\epsilon)\)</span>. This is basically saying that the pre-image of the
open interval <span class="math inline">\((f(a) - \epsilon, f(a) +
\epsilon)\)</span> strictly contains the set <span
class="math inline">\((a - \delta, a + \delta) \cap X\)</span> which is
an open set under the space <span class="math inline">\((A,
\tau_A)\)</span> and so it lines up with the topological definition
since it follows the pattern that is the pre-image of an open set is
related to open sets. You can just go a bit further from there to prove
that the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon - \delta\)</span>
definition implies the topological definition.</p>
<p>I suppose I simply wasn’t thinking much about how much it makes sense
since my mind was just thinking of it as facts. That it HAS to be true
and I’m just being stupid for not being able to prove it. One thing
which also caused me to get even more confused is the fact that I
actually did not have a very good understanding of the funtion
declaration notation. I thought that <span class="math inline">\(f: X
\to Y\)</span> doesn’t necessarily mean that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is defined for all of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and on some occasions, I even thought
that it is deined for all <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> but
then <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is xtrictly equal to <span
class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The lesson to be taken here for me after going through all of that
is</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the “function declaration notation” better. <span
class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> is saying that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is defined for all elements of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</li>
<li>Be more mindul about the specific topologies you’re dealing with
when dealing with topological spaces in topology.</li>
<li>Be more mindful when looking at definitions/problems especially when
it comes from unfamiliar sources. If it comes from unfamiliar sources,
then the statement of the problem from that source may depend on
previous assumptions, concepts, notations and so on defined on the
source which may cause some confusion just like what happened in
here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, the following will be my proof that these two definitions are
equivalent.</p>

that the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon - \delta\)</span>

<p><strong>Definition 3 (Standard Topology of <span

class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the standard topology if <span

<p><strong>Definition 4 (Relative Topology).</strong> If <span

class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\tau_A = \{ U \cap A | U \in \tau \}\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that this implies any <span class="math inline">\(B \in
A\)</span> is an open set in <span class="math inline">\((A,
\tau_A)\)</span> if and only if, for all <span class="math inline">\(b
\in B\)</span>, there exists an <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\((b - \epsilon, b + \epsilon) \cap A \subseteq
B\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lemma 1 (Open Sets are Intersections of Open
Intervals).</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is
an open set in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, then
there exists a set of open intervals <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\bigcup_{I \in S} I = A\)</span> and for all <span
class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>, there exists an <span
class="math inline">\(I \in S\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(a \in I\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Proof.</em> By definition, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
satisfy for all <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> there
exists an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> such that
for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in (a - \epsilon, a +
\epsilon)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span>. Now
define <span class="math inline">\(S = \{(a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon) |
a \in A, \epsilon &gt; 0 \text{ satisfies } (a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon)
\subseteq A \}\)</span>. Since such an <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> always exists for any <span
class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>, then there is always an open
interval <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> which contains <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(a
\in A\)</span> (which is already one part of the lemma proved) meaning
<span class="math inline">\(a \in \bigcup_{I \in S} I\)</span> and so
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a subset of the union. By
definition, everything in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is an
interval in the form of <span class="math inline">\((a - \epsilon, a +
\epsilon) \subseteq A\)</span> so since we’re literally just unionizing
a set of subsets of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> then the
result, <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup_{I \in S} I\)</span> must
also be a subset of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> (<span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span>)
Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> satisfy for all <span
class="math inline">\(x_0 \in X, \epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> there exists a
<span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> where for all <span

it follows that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in (f(x_0) - \epsilon,

<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in <span

<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to be <span
class="math inline">\(A = f^{-1}(B)\)</span> which is known to be a
subset of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is empty, then we already
know that it’s an open set.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is non-empty, we want to
prove that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is open under the
topology <span class="math inline">\(\tau_X\)</span>.</li>
<li>We know that for all <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>,
since <span class="math inline">\(a \in X\)</span> as well, then for all
<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> there exists a
<span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f((a - \delta, a + \delta) \cap X) \subseteq (f(a)
- \epsilon, f(a) + \epsilon)\)</span></li>
<li>By the openness of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we know
that for all <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span> there exists
an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\((b - \epsilon, b + \epsilon) \in B\)</span></li>
<li>Since <span class="math inline">\(f(a) \in B\)</span>, we can pick
the same epsilon as before and the corresponding delta and know that
<span class="math inline">\(B \supseteq (f(a) - \epsilon, f(a) +
\epsilon) \supseteq f((a - \delta, a + \delta) \cap X)\)</span> which
implies <span class="math inline">\((a - \delta, a + \delta) \cap X
\subseteq A\)</span></li>
<li>It can be concluded that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is
closed under the relative topology <span

applies for all <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\impliedby\)</span>) Suppose the
pre-image of every open set in <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R},

<ul>
<li>We want to prove that for any <span class="math inline">\(x_0 \in X,
\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> there exists a <span
class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \in (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta) \cap X\)</span>
implies <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in (f(x_0) - \epsilon, f(x_0)
+ \epsilon)\)</span></li>
<li>Take any <span class="math inline">\(x_0 \in X, \epsilon &gt;
0\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\((f(x_0) - \epsilon, f(x_0)
+ \epsilon)\)</span> is an open set since it’s an open interval, then
it’s pre-image <span class="math inline">\(S = f^{-1}((f(x_0) -
\epsilon, f(x_0) + \epsilon))\)</span> is known to also be an open set
under the space <span class="math inline">\((X, \tau_X)\)</span> and it
also known that <span class="math inline">\(x_0 \in S\)</span> because
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the pre-image of a set which
contains <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Since <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is an open set under
the space <span class="math inline">\((X, \tau_X)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_0 \in S\)</span> then by definition there exists
a <span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> such that for all
<span class="math inline">\(x \in (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta) \cap
X\)</span> it follows that <span class="math inline">\(x \in S\)</span>
therefore <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in (f(x_0) - \epsilon,
f(x_0) + \epsilon)\)</span></li>
<li>Since such a delta can be found for any <span
class="math inline">\(x_0 \in A, \epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, then we have
proven that the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon - \delta\)</span>
definition is also true.</li>
</ul>
<p>And yeah we’re done with everything now. Note that the lemma didn’t
actually end up being used. I thought it would end up being used since I
wrote it before writing fully thinking out the actual proof. I’ll keep
it in here because why not.</p>
