<h1 class="title">Regarding sequences in the form of <span

class="math inline">\(|r| \geq 2\)</span></h1>
</header>
<style>

</style>
<p>Before I go into such sequences, I will first make one thing
clear</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; x &lt; b\)</span>,
then:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{a} &lt; x &lt;
\frac{1}{b}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; 0
&lt; b\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{a} &gt; x &gt;
\frac{1}{b}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b
&lt; 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; a &lt; b\)</span>.
In other words, they are of the same sign.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now for the actual sequence. On which subsets of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> does it converge on depending on
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>? What are it’s limit points? We
will limit our view to <span class="math inline">\(|r| \geq 2\)</span>
for reasons that will be clear later. What are it’s limit points in that
case?</p>
<h2 id="constant-points-of-frac1r---x">Constant points of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r - x}\)</span></h2>
<p>To find the constant points of the function, which should intuitively
translate to the limit points of the sequence, you can simply try to
solve <span class="math inline">\(x = \frac{1}{r - x}\)</span> for x. Of
course, an obvious concern with trying to find the limit points like
this is that this means we are assuming that such a value exists. We
will not concern ourselves with this for now, we will only intuitively
think about why this is valid by simply verifying that the resulting
value for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is algebraically valid
and satisfy the original equation.</p>
<p>By using the quadratic equation, you can conclude that <span
class="math inline">\(x = \frac{r \pm \sqrt{r^2 - 4}}{2}\)</span>. We
will attempt to verify that this is value satisfies the original
equation. The most straightforward way to do this is by literally doing
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1 - x}\)</span> and seeing if it is
equal to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
x &amp;= \frac{r \pm \sqrt{r^2 - 4}}{2} \\
r - x &amp;= \frac{r \mp \sqrt{r^2 - 4}}{2} \\
\frac{1}{r - x} &amp;= \frac{2}{r \mp \sqrt{r^2 - 4}} \\
&amp;= \frac{2}{r \mp \sqrt{r^2 - 4}} \cdot \frac{r \pm \sqrt{r^2 -
4}}{r \pm \sqrt{r^2 - 4}} \\
&amp;= \frac{2 r \pm \sqrt{r^2 - 4}}{(r^2 - (r^2 - 4))} \\
&amp;= \frac{2 r \pm \sqrt{r^2 - 4}}{4} \\
&amp;= \frac{r \pm \sqrt{r^2 - 4}}{2} \\
&amp;= x
\end{align*}
\]</span> and so, yes, such an <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
really does satisfy the original equation. We now intuitively know the
constant points of the sequence function which should intuitively
translate to limit points of the sequence. Now it’s clear that the
reason we used <span class="math inline">\(|r| \geq 2\)</span> earlier
is that, if it less than two, then based on this formula, the limit
points will be undefined. Now we will actually start investigating the
convergence of this sequence based on the starting point <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span>.</p>

investigation of the sequence depending on the starting value <span
class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition 4.1.1.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(f(x)
= \frac{1}{r - x}\)</span><br />
Which is simply the sequence operation</li>
<li><strong>Definition 4.1.2.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(k_d =
\sqrt{r^2 - 4}\)</span><br />
Therefore the limit points of <span class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span>
is now of the form <span class="math inline">\(\frac{r \pm
k_d}{2}\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Observation 4.1.1.</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(|k_d| &lt; |r|\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Definition 4.1.3.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(k_1,
k_2\)</span> are limit points of <span
class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(|k_1| &lt; |k_2|\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(|r| &gt; 2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_1 = k_2\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(|r| = 2\)</span>.<br />
Therefore <span class="math inline">\(k_1, k_2\)</span> is defined to
both be in the form of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{r \pm
k_d}{2}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; 0\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(k_1 = \frac{r - k_d}{2}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2 = \frac{r + k_d}{2}\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(r &lt; 0\)</span>, then the sign of <span
class="math inline">\(k_d\)</span> will be flipped from each of <span
class="math inline">\(k_1, k_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Properties of <span class="math inline">\(k_1, k_2\)</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation 4.1.2.</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(|k_1|, |k_2| &lt; |r|\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(|k_1 - r|, |k_2 - r| &lt; |r|\)</span> in other
words <span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> is between 0 and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(|k_1|, |k_2| &lt; |r|\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(|k_1 - r|, |k_2 - r| &lt; |r|\)</span> in other
words <span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> is between 0 and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> By the triangle inequality following
from <span class="math inline">\(|k_d| &lt; |r|\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(|\frac{r \pm k_d}{2}| \leq |\frac{r}{2}| +
|\frac{k_d}{2}| &lt; |r|\)</span>. It is also known that <span
class="math inline">\(k - r = \frac{\pm k_d - r}{2}\)</span> which means
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\pm k_d - r}{2} \leq |\frac{k_d}{2}| +
|\frac{r}{2}| &lt; |r|\)</span>. End of proof.</li>
<li><strong>Observation 4.1.3.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(r -
k_1 = \frac{1}{k_1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r - k_2 =
\frac{1}{k_2}\)</span><br />
This is because, if <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a number
which satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r - k} =
k\)</span>, which we know is true for <span class="math inline">\(k_1,
k_2\)</span>, then it implies <span class="math inline">\(r - k =
\frac{1}{k}\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Observation 4.1.4.</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(|\frac{1}{r}| &lt; |k_2|\)</span><br />
This is beacuse <span class="math inline">\(|r| \geq 2\)</span> meaning
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r} &lt; 1\)</span> yet since <span
class="math inline">\(|k_2| = \frac{|r|}{2} + \frac{k_d}{2}\)</span>
then <span class="math inline">\(|k_2| \geq 1\)</span> since <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{|r|}{2} \geq 1\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Observation 4.1.5.</strong> When <span
class="math inline">\(r \geq 2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq a &lt; b &lt; r\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq f(a) &lt; f(b)\)</span> and when <span
class="math inline">\(r \leq 2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r &lt; a &lt; b \leq 0\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f(a) &lt; f(b) &lt; 0\)</span>. In other words,
the sequence operation preserves inequalities on values between zero and
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.<br />
This is because in the case where <span class="math inline">\(r \geq
2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r \geq r - a &gt; r - b &gt;
0\)</span> which means everything still has the same sign and so taking
it’s reciprocal reverts it to the original inequalities. You can also do
something similar for when <span class="math inline">\(r \leq
2\)</span>.</li>
<li>The following bullet points will be an investigation of the
sequence’s convergence by splitting it into four cases.<br />
When <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is between <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and zero including zero, <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is between <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is of opposite signs than <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is of the same sign as <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> yet <span class="math inline">\(|x_n|
&gt; |r|\)</span>.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is inbetween <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or equal to <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(x_{n+1}\)</span> is inbetween <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.<br />
This is because suppose <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq x_n &lt;
k_2\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r} \leq x_{n+1}
&lt; k_2\)</span> by observations 4.1.2. and 4.1.5. It’s also similar
for when <span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; x_n &lt; 0\)</span>. This
implies the sequence is monotone when <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is betewen <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. This is because suppose <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; x_{n} &lt; x_{n+1} &lt; k_2\)</span> then
since both of them is between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (because <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> is between <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>) then the inequality is preserved under
the sequence operation therefore <span class="math inline">\(x_{n+1}
&lt; x_{n+2} &lt; k_2\)</span>. It’s also similar for when <span
class="math inline">\(x_{n} &gt; x_{n+1}\)</span>. This implies that
<span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is monotone and bounded
starting from the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is inbetween zero and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and so by the MCT, it is
convergent.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is of different signs
than <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(x_{n+1}\)</span> will be of the same sign as <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and is inbetween <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and zero.<br />
This is because suppose <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; 0\)</span>,
then when <span class="math inline">\(x_n &lt; 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(r - x_n &gt; r\)</span> and so <span
class="math inline">\(x_{n+1} &lt; \frac{1}{r}\)</span>. Now since <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r}\)</span> is actually inbetween 0 and
<span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> by observation 4.1.4., then
<span class="math inline">\(x_{n+1}\)</span> is inbetween zero and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> meaning you can fallback to the
previous case and so <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span>
converges.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is of the same sign as
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(|x_n| &gt; |r|\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(x_{n+1}\)</span> is of the opposite signs of <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> meaning you can fallback into the
previous case and know that the sequence converges.<br />
Then is because suppose <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; 2\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(x_n &gt; r\)</span>. Then clearly <span
class="math inline">\(r - x_n &lt; 0\)</span> meaning <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r - x_n} = x_{n+1} &lt; 0\)</span>. Same
for when <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; 2\)</span>.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is inbetween <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> including <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. This is where it gets
interesting.<br />
I will tell you straight the sequence diverges only on a countably
infinite subset of <span class="math inline">\((k_2, r]\)</span> and
then it converges on the rest. The following proof of that will only be
for the case where <span class="math inline">\(r \geq 2\)</span> because
I am too stupid with absolute value inequalities however it is easily
changed so that it would work with <span class="math inline">\(r \leq
2\)</span> by changing the inequalities and stuff.
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition 4.1.4.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(g_1 =
r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g_n = f^{-1}(g_{n-1})\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(g = \lim g_n\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Observation 4.1.6.</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(k_2) = k_2\)</span><br />
By observation 4.1.3., <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{k_2} = r -
k_2\)</span> therefore <span class="math inline">\(r - \frac{1}{k_2} =
k_2 = f^{-1}(k_2)\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Observation 4.1.7.</strong> When <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is of the same sign, <span
class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> preserves their inequality.<br />
Proof: Since they are of the same sign, then taking their reciprocal
flips their inequality and negating their reciprocals returns their
inequality back to the original. Adding <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to that will still keep the same
inequality. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(a) = r -
\frac{1}{a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(b) = r -
\frac{1}{b}\)</span> has the same inequality relation as <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Observation 4.1.8.</strong> For all natural <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt;
g_{n+1} &lt; g_n \leq r\)</span>. In other words, <span
class="math inline">\(g_n\)</span> is always between <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> including <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> AND <span
class="math inline">\((g_n)\)</span> always moves in the direction of
<span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> yet it is bounded by <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span>.<br />
For <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span>, it’s clear that <span
class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; g_1 \leq r\)</span> since, well, <span
class="math inline">\(g_1 = r\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(r \geq 2\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \frac{1}{r} &lt; 1\)</span> meaning <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; r - \frac{1}{r} &lt; r\)</span> and so
<span class="math inline">\(g_2 &lt; g_1\)</span>. And by observation
4.1.7. and observation 4.1.6., <span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt;
g_1\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(k_2) = k_2 &lt;
g_2\)</span>. You can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt;
g_2 &lt; g_1 \leq r\)</span>. Suppose for some natural <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(k_2
&lt; g_{n+1} &lt; g_n \leq r\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; g_{n+2} &lt; g_{n+1} \leq r\)</span> by
observation 4.1.7. and observation 4.1.6. and the fact that <span
class="math inline">\(g_{n+1} \leq r\)</span> is known to be true.</li>
<li>Proof that <span class="math inline">\(\lim g_n\)</span>
exists<br />
By observation 4.1.8., <span class="math inline">\((g_n)\)</span> is
monotone and is bounded in the direction that it is monotone in
therefore by the MCT it is convergent.</li>
<li>It will be proven that if there exists a natural <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is exclusively between <span
class="math inline">\(g_{m+1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g_m\)</span>. then <span
class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> converges. Otherwise, if there’s a
natural <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x_n = g_m\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> diverges. It should be intuitive to
say that <span class="math inline">\(g = \lim g_n\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> however I’m actually not sure on how
to prove that. Therefore, this part case will be split into two
possibilities: First is if <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is
between <span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> including <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and the second is if <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> is between <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> including <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</li>
<li>If there exists a natural <span class="math inline">\(m, n\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(x_n = g_m\)</span>, then composing
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(m-1\)</span> times with <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> results in <span
class="math inline">\(x_{n+m-1} = g_1 = r\)</span> meaning <span
class="math inline">\(f(x_{n+m})\)</span> is undefined since <span
class="math inline">\(f(r) = \frac{1}{r - r} = \frac{1}{0}\)</span> is
undefined.</li>
<li>If there exists a natural <span class="math inline">\(m, n\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(x_n \in (g_{m+1}, g_m)\)</span>,
then composing <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(m-1\)</span> times with <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> results in <span
class="math inline">\(x_{n+m-1} \in (g_2, g_1) = (r - \frac{1}{r},
r)\)</span> meaning <span class="math inline">\(r - \frac{1}{r} &lt;
x_{n+m-1} &lt; r\)</span> which implies <span class="math inline">\(r
&lt; x_{n+m}\)</span> therefore you can fallback into the case where
<span class="math inline">\(|x_n| &gt; |r|\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> having the same signs.</li>
<li>If there exists a natural <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(x_n \in (k_2, g]\)</span>. It’s
clear that <span class="math inline">\(g \leq g_m\)</span> for all
natural <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> since in this case, by
observation 4.1.8., <span class="math inline">\((g_m)\)</span> is
decreasing. This implies that <span class="math inline">\((k_2, g]
\subseteq (k_2, g_m]\)</span> meaning <span class="math inline">\(k_2
&lt; x_n \leq g_m\)</span> for all natural <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. This means that <span
class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; x_{n+1} \leq g_{m-1}\)</span> for all
natural <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> excluding <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> which is the exact same as saying that
<span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; x_{n+1} \leq g_m\)</span> for all
natural <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. By the order limit
theroems, this implies that <span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; x_{n+1}
\leq g\)</span>. By induction, you can conclude that for all natural
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k_2
&lt; x_{n+N} \leq g\)</span> and so <span
class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> is bounded. Since <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> preserves ineqalities for values of
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> between <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and it is known that <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is clearly between <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> is always between <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> starting from a certain <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, then you can say that <span
class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> is monotone. Since it is monotone
and bounded in this scenario, then it converges. Hurray!</li>
<li>It will be proven that we have covered all cases of when <span
class="math inline">\(x_n \in (k_2, r]\)</span>. This means proving that
<span class="math inline">\((k_2, r] \subseteq \left( \bigcup_{i \in
\mathbb{N}} [g_{i+1}, g_i] \right) \cup (k_2, g]\)</span>. Well that
should be obvious anyway. If <span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; x_n
\leq r\)</span>, then either <span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; x_n
\leq g\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g &lt; x_n \leq
r\)</span>. We already explicitly unionized the case of <span
class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; x_n \leq g\)</span> so we only need to
prove that <span class="math inline">\((g, r] \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in
\mathbb{N}} [g_{i+1}, g_i]\)</span>. Now suppose <span
class="math inline">\(g &lt; x \leq r\)</span>. By the definition of
limits, for all <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>
there exists an <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(|g_m - g| &lt; \epsilon\)</span> yet we know that
in this case <span class="math inline">\((g_m)\)</span> is decreasing
therefore <span class="math inline">\(g_m \geq g\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> otherwise it would lead to a
contradiction. This implies that <span class="math inline">\(g \leq g_m
&lt; g + \epsilon\)</span> so you can pick <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon = x - g\)</span> which would mean that
there always exists an <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(g \leq g_m &lt; x\)</span>. In that case,
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> also cannot be <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> since otherwise <span
class="math inline">\(g_1 = r &lt; x\)</span> which is a contradiction
to the fact that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is supposed to
be less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. Now
pick the smallest <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> possible for
such an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. This means <span
class="math inline">\(g_m &lt; x \leq g_{m-1} \leq g_1 = r\)</span>
since <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the smallest <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> possible. Therefore there exists an
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \in [g_m, g_{m-1}]\)</span> and so yeah it is in
the infinite union.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>IN CONCLUSION the sequence converges on a most points except for some
small countably infinite set of points which are points defined by
applying <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> an arbitrary amount of times.</p>
<p>Now you can combine this with <a
href="./specific-monotone-sequences-exact-limit.html">specific monotone
sequences exact limit</a> to know that <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> are actually limit points of all such
sequences which converges. Because I’m lazy, I will only prove the case
where <span class="math inline">\(r \geq 2\)</span>. The strategy is to
prove that <span class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> is strictly
increasing in <span class="math inline">\((0, k_1)\)</span> and is
strictly decreasing in <span class="math inline">\((k_1,
k_2)\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; x &lt; k_1\)</span>, then
we want to prove that <span class="math inline">\(x &lt;
f(x)\)</span>.<br />
This is equivalent to proving that <span class="math inline">\(xr - x^2
- 1 &lt; 0\)</span> which we know by basic properties of quadratics and
the fact that the second degree coefficient is negative, is satisfied
for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that is NOT inbetween
<span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span> which is in the range of <span
class="math inline">\((0, k_1)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(k_1 &lt; x &lt; k_2\)</span>,
then we want to prove that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt;
x\)</span>.<br />
This is equivalent to proving that <span class="math inline">\(xr - x^2
- 1 &gt; 0\)</span> which, again, by basic properties of quadratics and
the fact that the second degree coefficient is negative, it’s satisfied
for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that is inbetween <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(x \in (0, k_1)\)</span>, we want
to prove that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in (0, k_1)\)</span>. By
the original statement, we know that <span class="math inline">\(r - x
\in (r - k_1, r)\)</span> and since <span class="math inline">\(k_1 &lt;
r\)</span> by observation 4.1.2. then <span class="math inline">\(r -
k_1, r &gt; 0\)</span> therefore reciprocals flip their inequalities and
so <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r - x} \in (\frac{1}{r},
\frac{1}{r - k_1})\)</span> meaning <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt;
\frac{1}{r - x} &lt; k_1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(k_1 &lt; x &lt; k_2\)</span>, we
want to prove that <span class="math inline">\(k_1 &lt; f(x) &lt;
k_2\)</span>.<br />
We know that <span class="math inline">\(k_1, k_2 &lt; r\)</span> by
observation 4.1.2., therefore it’s true that <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; r - k_1, r - k_2\)</span> meaning <span
class="math inline">\(r - k_1 &gt; r - x &gt; r - k_2 &gt; 0\)</span>
therefore reciprocals flip all of the inequalities and so <span
class="math inline">\(k_1 &lt; \frac{1}{r - x} &lt; k_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(x_1 &lt; x_2 \in (0,
k_2)\)</span>, we want to prove that <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1)
&lt; f(x_2)\)</span> (the function is increasing)<br />
It’s known that <span class="math inline">\(k_2 &lt; r\)</span> by
observation 4.1.2. therefore it is enough to prove that it’s true for
all <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2 \in (0, r)\)</span> so let’s
suppose that instead. <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2
&lt; r\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(0 &gt; -x_1 &gt;
-x_2 &gt; -r\)</span> meaning <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; r - x_1
&gt; r - x_2 &gt; 0\)</span> implying they are all of the same sign
meaning reciprocals flip their inequalities and so <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r} &lt; f(x_1) &lt; f(x_2) &lt;
\infty\)</span> and so yes the function is increasing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposition and lemma in the theorems imply that <span
class="math inline">\(x_n \in (0, k_2)\)</span> means <span
class="math inline">\(\lim (x_n) = k_1\)</span>. This is because <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) &gt; x\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(x \in (0, k_1)\)</span> and so it converges to
<span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> by the main proposition, and
then <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt; x\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(x \in (k_1, k_2)\)</span> and so it converges to
<span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> as well by the corollary of the
proposition. Obviously <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> also satisfies all of the other
conditions needed for both of those propositions to apply, I was simply
stating the main reasons which decides whether to use the main
proposition or the corollary when I said that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) &gt; x\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt; x\)</span>.</p>
<p>We know that if <span class="math inline">\((x_n)\)</span> is
convergent and <span class="math inline">\(x_1 \notin (0, k_2)\)</span>,
it eventually goes to <span class="math inline">\((0, k_2)\)</span>
unless it’s originally <span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span>.
Therefore, unless <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = k_2\)</span>, then
the sequence always converges to <span
class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span>.</p>
