        <h1>Exercises on my analysis book part 1</h1>
        <b>Exercise 1.6.1.</b> Show that $(0, 1)$ is uncountable if and only if $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. <br>
        The book already gave a bijective function from $(-1, 1)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ on the earlier pages so this is pretty easy.
        Take the function $f(x) = x/(x^2 - 1)$.
        <!-- which is a bijective function from earlier pages of the book from $(-1, 1)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and make $g(x) = f(2x - 1)$ therefore, with a little algebra, $g(x) = \frac{2x - 1}{4(x^2 - x)}$ -->
        It will be proven that $f$ maps $(-1, 1)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ bijectively.
        The range of this function is already definitely a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ so that's one part done.
        Take any $r \in \mathbb{R}$, with a little bit of algebra from solving $r = \frac{x}{x^2 - 1}$, you can take $x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{2r}$ and see:
        $$
        \begin{align*}
        f(\frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{2r}) &= \frac{\frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{2r}}{(\frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{2r})^2 - 1} \\
        &= \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{(\frac{(1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2})^2}{2r}) - 2r} \\
        &= \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{\frac{(1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2})^2 - 4r^2}{2r}} \\
        &= \frac{2r(1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2})}{(1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2})^2 - 4r^2} \\
        &= \frac{2r(1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2})}{1 - 2\sqrt{1 + 4r^2} + 1 + 4r^2 - 4r^2} \\
        &= \frac{2r(1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2})}{2 - 2\sqrt{1 + 4r^2}} \\
        &= \frac{2r(1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2})}{2(1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2})} \\
        &= r\\
        \end{align*}
        $$
        Now to prove that $x \in (-1, -1)$. The idea is that, when $r$ is zero, the expression is also zero which is in the interval.
        While when $r$ is non-zero, the square root is strictly less than 1 + |2r| (which is not true if r is zero) while also being strictly higher than |2r|.
        That would imply that the final expression is in the interval.
        Here's the complete proof: <br>
        Lemma 1: Suppose $a > 0$, then $\sqrt{a + b^2} = \sqrt{a} + |b|$ if and only if $b = 0$. <br>
        Proof: $\sqrt{a + b^2} = \sqrt{a} + |b|$ imply $a + b^2 = a + 2\sqrt{a}|b| + b^2$ which imply $\sqrt{a}|b| = 0$. Since $\sqrt{a}$ is non-zero, then $|b|$ must be zero which also mean $b = 0$. 
        If $b = 0$, then:
        $$\sqrt{a + b^2} = \sqrt{a + 0} = \sqrt{a} + 0 = \sqrt{a} + |b|$$<br>
        Lemma 2: Suppose $a > 0$ and $b \neq 0$, then $\sqrt{a + b^2} < \sqrt{a} + |b|$ <br>
        Proof: The statement imply $2\sqrt{a}|b| > 0$ therefore $a + b^2 < a + 2\sqrt{a}|b| + b^2 = \left( a + |b| \right)^2$ which imply $\sqrt{a + b^2} < a + |b|$ <br>
        <br>
        When $r = 0$, $\frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{2r} = 0/0$, taking the limit of the expression, maybe by using L'Hopital or something, it is equal to 0.
        when $r \neq 0$, by lemma 2 (setting a = 1), it is known that $\sqrt{1 + 4r^2} < 1 + |2r|$ but it is also known that $|2r| < \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}$.
        Therefore, you can now do:
        $$
        \begin{align*}
        |2r| < \sqrt{1 + 4r^2} < 1 + |2r| &\implies |2r| - 1 < \sqrt{1 + 4r^2} - 1 < |2r| && \text{(substract by 1)} \\
        &\implies 1 - |2r| > 1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2} > -|2r| && \text{(negate)} \\
        &\implies \frac{1}{|2r|} - 1 > \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{|2r|} > -1 && \text{(divide by $|2r|$)} \\
        &\implies 0 > \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{|2r|} > -1 && \text{(for the positive case)} \\ 
        &\implies 0 < \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{-|2r|} < 1 && \text{(for the negative case)} \\
        &\implies -1 < \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 4r^2}}{2r} < 1 \\ 
        \end{align*}
        $$
        Therefore the expression is always in the interval $(-1, 1)$
        <br><br>
        Note that some exercises are skipped because I already did them on my notebook. <br>
        <b>Exercise 1.6.5.</b> (b) If $A$ is finite with $n$ elements, show that $P(A)$ has $2^n$ elements. <br>
        Proof: This will be proved by induction. Define $A_0 = \emptyset$ and $A_n$ such that $|A_n| = |A_{n - 1}| + 1$ and $A_{n-1} \subset A_n$.
        Since $|A_0| = 0$, then $|A_n| = n$ for any $n$. With the way $A_n$ is defined, it is able to represent any finite set of size $n$.
        The definition also implies that $\exists a_n \in A_n$ such that $a_n \notin A_{n-1}$ yet for any $k \in A_n$ where $k \neq a_n$, $k \in A_{n-1}$.
        In other words, there is only a single new element in $A_n$ compared to $A_{n-1}$.
        Therefore, you can create an alternative definition of each of $A_n$ to be $A_n = \{a_1, ..., a_n\}$ and then $A_{n+1} = \{a_1, ..., a_{n+1}\} = A_n \cup \{ a_{n+1} \}$
        where each of $a_k$ may represent <i>any</i> value of the set which also satisfy $a_k \in A_j \forall j \geq k$ while $a_k \notin A_l \forall l < k$.
        I mean, technically, I need to prove that a sequence of sets that satisfy the first condition stated above also states the latter definition AND vice-versa to say that it is an equivalent definition, but I think it's trivial enough.<br>
        Now for the induction: <br>
        (i) $P(A_0) = \{ \emptyset \}$, |P(A_0)| = 1 = $2^n$ <br>
        (ii) When $|P(A_n)| = 2^n$, it will be proven that $P(A_{n+1}) = 2^{n+1}$. Define $f: P(A_n) \to P(A_{n+1})$ with $f(s) = s \cup \{ a_{n+1} \}$ and define $H = \{ f(s) | s \in P(A_n) \}$.
        I will now state an assumption that will be used in here. If S and C are finite sets and $f: S \to C$ is 1-1 and K is defined as $K = \{ f(s) | s \in S \}$, then $|K| = |S|$.
        This is obviously because every element of K is based on an element of S in such a way that any 2 different elements in S creates two different elements that will be put into K because $f$ is 1-1.
        Going back to the previous $f$, it will be proven that $f$ is 1-1. 
        Take any $s_1, s_2 \in P(A_n)$ such that $s_1 \neq s_2$. It is also known that $a_{n+1} \notin s_1, s_2$, therefore $s_1 \cup \{ a_{n+1} \} \neq s_2 \cup \{ a_{n+1} \}$.
        This is true based on the general trivial assumption that for any three sets $A, B, C$ such that $A \neq B$ and $A \cap C = B \cap C = \emptyset$, then it also follows that $A \cup C \neq B \cup C$.
        All of that implies that $|H| = |P(A_n)|$ because $H, P(A_n)$ is finite and $f$ is 1-1 and the assumption from before. 
        Since any result of $f(s)$ contains $a_{n+1}$, any result of $f(s)$ is not in $A_n$ and so $H \cap P(A_n) = \emptyset$.
        This means $|H \cup P(A_n)| = |P(A_n)| + |H| = 2|P(A_n)| = 2^{n+1}$. It will now be proven that $H \cup P(A_n) = P(A_{n+1})$ which would imply $|P(A_{n+1})| = 2^{n+1}$.
        Take any $k \in P(A_{n+1})$, $a_{n+1}$ is either in k or not in k. If $a_{n+1}$ is not in $k$, then $k \in P(A_n)$ because $A_n = \{ a_1, ..., a_n \}$ and $A_{n+1} = \{ a_1, ..., a_{n+1} \}$.
        If $a_{n+1}$ is in $k$, then $k \backslash \{ a_{n+1} \} \in P(A_n)$ and so $k \in H$ because it is an element of $P(A_n)$ added with $a_{n+1}$. Therefore $k \in P(A_n) \cup H$.
        Then for any $j \in H \cup P(A_n)$, j is either in $H$ or $P(A_n)$. If it is in $P(A_n)$, then it is also in $P(A_{n+1})$ because $A_n \subset A_{n+1}$.
        If $j \in H$, then $\exists k \in P(A_n)$ such that $j = k \cup \{ a_{n+1} \}$ therefore $j \in P(A_{n+1})$ because $k \subseteq A_n$ implies $k \cup \{ a_{n+1} \} = j \subseteq A_n \cup \{ a_{n+1} \} = A_{n+1}$. Therefore $P(A_n) \cup H = P(A_{n+1})$ and so it can be concluded that $|P(A_{n+1})| = 2^{n+1}$.
        <br><br>
        Yup I am the absolute WORST at writing proofs. They are never clear and concise and always have a bunch of redundancy probably. Anyway, next.
        <br><br>
        <b>Theorem 1.6.2 (Cantor's Theorem).</b> Given any set $A$, <i>there does not exist</i> a function $f: A \to P(A)$ that is <i>onto</i>. <br>
        <b>Exercise 1.6.6. - Exercise 1.6.8.</b> Prove Cantor's Theorem. <br>
        The book basically slowly guides you into how you would prove this theorem, starting from using an obvious example of why you cannot have an onto mapping from a finite set to it's power set in Exercise 1.6.6.
        And then it tells you that you're supposed to prove Cantor's Theorem indirectly by assuming that such a function exists and say that, in that case, a contradictio would occur which is that if you create the set
        $B = \{ a \in A : a \notin f(a) \}$, then $f$ have not mapped anything in $A$ to $B$. Exercise 1.6.7. tells you to try to do this for finite sets before going generally into infinite sets in Exercise 1.6.8. <br><br>
        <br><br>
        In this exercise, I want to highlight a generalization of the template of a diagonalization argument that I learned from a YouTube video. Here's the diagram in the video:
        <!-- In a diagonalization argument, you have sets $A$ and $B$, a function $f: A^2 \to B$, then the function $g: A \to B$ and a function $h: A \to B$.
        These functions should satisfy: $g(a) = f(a, a)$, then $h(a) \neq g(a)$. -->
        $$
        \xymatrix{
        A^2 \ar[r]^f & B \ar[d]^h \\
        A \ar[u]^g \ar[r]_s & B
        }
        $$
        <!-- What's essentially going on here is that you have the sets A and B. A is for indexing (it will be N^2 for the uncountability of (0, 1)), and B will be the value for each input of $f$. 
        After that there's the function $h$ which "negates" a value of $B$ so it must satisfy $h(b) \neq b$. And then you have the function $g$ which does the diagonalization such that $g(a) = f(a, a)$.
        And then finally $s$ is the special function which is defined as $s(a) = h(g(a))$, therefore $s(a) \neq f(a, a)$ and so, as a function of $a$ with $j$ being locked, $s(a) \neq f(j, a)$ for any value of $j$ -->
        Now to explain this diagram. So, in general, the shared theme in diagonalization proofs is that you start with an indexed collection of functions, say functions $f_i : A \to B$ for any $i \in A$.
        And then you would try to create the function $s: A \to B$ that is not already in that indexed collection of functions.
        It does this by utilizing the indexing set of the collection is the same as domain of each of the functions in the collection which allows you to do a process called we know as diagonalization.
        So you can create $s$ by making it not equal to any $f_i$ by simply making the $s(i)$ not equal to $f_i(i)$. 
        And so in the process of defining $s$ on all of it's domain, you are essentially going through the process of getting the value of $f_i(i)$, and then creating a value that is not equal to that.
        In the diagram, the function which generates this not-equal value is $h$, and the function which goes from $i$ to $f_i(i)$ is $g$. 
        This diagram is just showing that $s$ is a composition of $g$, $f$, and $h$ IF you redefine $f_a(b)$ to be $f(a, b)$. Therefore, $s(i) = h(f(g(i)))$.
        Basically, this is an attempt to generalize diagonalization arguments using <i>category theory</i> which is what the video is actually about. It is an attempt at an introduction to category theory.
        <br><br>
        Anyway, for the actual proof of Cantor's Theorem. Start with a set $H$ and prove that any mapping from $H$ to $P(H)$ is not onto.
        Start by defining $k: H \to P(H)$ and assume that it is an onto mapping from $H$ to $P(H)$.
        By using the diagonalization proof template from before, you can define $A = H$, $B = \{ 0, 1 \}$. 
        And then define $f: A^2 \to B$ (which is just $f: H^2 \to \{ 0, 1 \}$) which, if called with $f(a, b)$, represents whether or not $b$ is in $k(a)$.

        This means, if you lock $a$ to be some element of $H$, then $f(a, b)$ completely represents $k(b)$ because $k(b) = \{ h | f(a, h) = 1 \}$.
        The point is that $f(a, b)$ with $a$ being locked is able to represent any subset of $H$. 
        The final goal is to create a set $S \in P(H)$ that $k$ have not mapped any element of $H$ to.
        This is equivalent to creating a function $s: A \to B$ that is not equal to any $f(a, x)$ as a function of $x$ with $a$ being locked to any element of H and then you can define $S = {b | s(b) = 1}$
        To do this, you create the function $g$ which does the diagonalization, therefore $g(i) = (i, i)$, and then create the function $h: B \to B$ which generates the "not-equal" value therefore $h(0) = 1$ and $h(1) = 0$.
        Then you define $s(i)$ to be $h(f(g(i)))$ which is the same as $h(f(i, i))$.
        The set that $s$ represents, S, cannot be equal to any $k(b)$. Because, suppose $b \in k(b)$, then, by definition, $f(b, b) = 1$ and so $s(b) = h(f(b, b)) = h(1) = 0$ and so $b$ is not in $S$ therefore $S \neq k(b)$.
        You can use basically the same logic for if $b \in k(b)$. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Exercise 1.6.9.</b> Give a compelling argument that $P(N) \sim \mathbb{R}$. <br>
        On earlier exercises, the book gave a guided proof to the Schroder-Bernstein theorem, which we should be able to use here. 
        So now we can just try to create a 1-1 mapping from $P(N)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and vice versa. <br>
        It shouldn't be too hard. You can define the mapping from $\mathbb{R}$ to $P(N)$ by making one from $(0, 1)$ to $P(N)$ and you should be able to do that using decimal representations.
        I'm imagining that you would map any element $r \in (0, 1)$ with it's (non-9-repeating) decimal representation being $r_n \in \{ 0, ..., 9 \}$ to be the set $\{ r_n \cdot 10^n | n \in \mathbb{N} \}$.
        Then for the mapping from $P(N)$ to $(0, 1)$, you can say that $p \in P(N)$ maps to a real number $r = 10^{-1} + \sum_{i \in p} 10^{-(p + 1)}$. In other words:
        $$f(p) = 10^{-1} + \sum_{i \in p} 10^{-(p + 1)}$$
        $$g(r) = \{ r_n \cdot 10^n | n \in \mathbb{N} \}$$
        The intuition is that $f$ creates a real number which has a decimal representation where the $(n + 1)$th digit after the decimal point is 1 if $n \in p$ and 0 if $n \notin p$.
        For example, the set $\{ 2, 4, 5 \}$ represents the real number $0.101011$.
        The reason that it's $(n + 1)$ instead of $n$ and we're also adding the sum with $0.1$ is to prevent the value that the empty set would represent from being $0$.
        Any two different sets cannot represent the same real number because two different decimal representations can only represent the same real number when one of them is 9-repeating.
        In this case, the resulting decimal representation is never 9-repeating.
        And the for $g$, it essentially creates a set of natural numbers such that 
        <!-- sqrt(4r^2) = |2r|
sqrt(1 + 4r^2) > |2r| > 0 -> (1)
1 - sqrt(1 + 4r^2) > 1 - |2r|
(1 - sqrt(1 + 4r^2))/(2r) > (1 - |2r|)/(2r)
(1 - sqrt(1 + 4r^2))/(2r) > (1 - |2r|)/(2r)

if r is positive:
(1 - sqrt(1 + 4r^2))/|2r| > 1/|2r| - 1
1/|2r| - sqrt(1 + 4r^2)/|2r| > 1/|2r| - 1
-sqrt(1 + 4r^2)/|2r| > -1
by (1), it also means:
0 > -sqrt(1 + 4r^2)/|2r| > -1
0 > 1/|2r| > (1 - sqrt(1 + 4r^2))/|2r| > -1 + 1/|2r| > -1
Therefore 0 > (1 - sqrt(1 + 4r^2))/|2r| > -1 -->
