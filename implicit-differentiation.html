        <h1>Implicit Differentation</h1>
        This is an interpretation of implicit differentation with multivariable calculus that I have.
        Implicit differentiation is a very useful concept of differentating an equation.
        For example, you can differentiate $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$ with implicit differentiation.
        The result of that will be $0 = 2xdx + 2ydy$.
        One way of interpreting that is, for certain values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the original equation,
        how can you change $y$ and $x$ so that the resulting equation still holds.
        Except that the statement "how you can change $x$ and $y$" talks more about how you can change them
        for the original equations such that <i>"the best linear approximation"</i> of the equation holds true.
        Another interpretation is that it gives you an equation in terms of the variables which represent
        how much you may $x$ and $y$ such that, as those delta variables get closer and closer to zero,
        the original equation would get closer and closer to being true.
        Which is very similar to the interpretations of derivatives
        which tells you the <i>ratio</i>, $\frac{dy}{dx}$, of the change in y and the change in x,
        such that as those two variables get closer to zero,
