        <h1>Brainstorms regarding polytopes</h1>
        Here are the questions that I had while brainstorming about polytopes: <br>
        1. How do you define and "construct" higher dimensional polytopes? <br>
        2. Point-collision of higher dimensional polytopes <br>
        3. Volume of higher dimensional polytopes <br>
        <br><br>
        I have noticed that in my attempt to formalize these notions, I still lack a lot of tools from Linear Algebra and Analysis that are in the books that I have but simply haven't read because I haven't reached the chapters for them.
        The strategy is to define the concept of a "closed-continuous-body" in a vector space V under F to be a set $C$ which satisfies: <br>
        1. For any two vectors $v_1,\ v_2$ in C, there exist a continuous function $f: [0, 1] -> C$ such that $f(0) = v_1$ and $f(1) = v_2$ and $\forall r \in [0, 1]$, $f(r) \in C$ <br> 
        2. $\forall v \in V,\ c \in C$ where $v$ is not the additive identity of $V$, there exists $\lambda \in F$ such that $\lambda c = O$ satisfies $O \in C$ and $\forall \epsilon \geq 0$, $O + \epsilon v \notin C$ <br>
        The issue is that I still haven't properly studied what it means for a function vector-valued function like that to be continuous and maybe the details of what the range and image of a continuous function must satisfy.
        I'm imagining that we can define what it means for a function from $R$ to a euclidean vector space BECAUSE there exists the concept of "distance," but not all vector spaces may have that.
        Here's my attempt at writing what it means for a function to be continuous:
        Define a metric set $A$ to be a set with a distance function $d_A: A -> R_+$ which satisfies $d_A(a, a) = 0$, and $d_A(a, b) \leq d_A(a, c) + d_A(b, c)$
        A function $f: A -> B$ from a measurable set A and B is continuous if and only if 
        Yeah I kinda cheated there, I researched the definition of continuity and metric spaces, I learned something new anyway though that's all that matters.
        <br><br>
        Next is to define the concept of the affine space $A$ of a set of vectors $C$ in $V$ to be the set of all vectors $v$ that satisfies:
        $\exists k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\exists O, u_1, ..., u_k \in C$ where $\exists \lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k$ which satisfies $$

        <!-- I will attempt to explain what I mean by starting from the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional case.
        In 2-dimensions, you can define a polygon using a list of points arranged in a certain order.
        Then you can visually think of the polygon in terms of it's line-segment boundaries where each line-segment is defined by each adjacent pair of points in the list. 
        And that method seem like the most natural way to represent them.
        However with the way I'm gonna explain it right now, it is a bit different for the purpose of ease of generalization. -->
        <br><br>
        <!-- A point-extension operation is an operation which generally takes a polytope and a face of the polytope, and a point as parameters for the operation, and creates a new polytope based on them.
        There are two undefined words there: dimension and face.
        Define a polytope as a set F of euclidean vectors that can be defined in the steps defined later.
        A polytope is N-dimensional if you can find a list of N+1 vectors inside of the polytope such that, if you take an element K in the list and the sublist that does not contain K denoted S, the list of vectors made from every element of S substracted by K is linearly independent and it's span contains every element in F substracted by K.
        In other words, a polytope is N-dimensional if $\exists L = v_1, ..., v_{n+1}$ s.t. $\forall k \in {1, ..., n + 1}$, $S = L \backslash v_{k} - v_{k}$, where the substraction substracts every element of $L \backslash v_k$ by $v_k$, is linearly independent and $\forall f \in F$, $f - v_k \in \text{span}(S)$.
        Now to define the "face" of a polytope. This is an interesting problem in-itself and I'm actually not sure yet on how to do that.
        I will only define the intuitive definition of a face which is just a boundary of a polytope which itself is a polytope that is contained inside of the polytope that it's a face of.
        An N-dimensional polytope has faces of dimensions 1 to N-1.
        A 0-dimensional face is a point, a 1-dimensional face is a line, a 2-dimensional face is a plane, and so on.
        A cube has eight 0-dimensional faces, twelve 1-dimensional faces, and six 2-dimensional faces.
        I will also define the affine space of a polytope F as being the set of all vectors that, if substracted by any vector V in the polytope, it can be made by a linear combination of a list of vectors in the polytope added by V.
        In other words, the set of all vectors $A$ where there exists $k \in N$ such that there exists $O, v_1, ..., v_k \in F$, $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(v_i - O) = A$
        <br><br>
        There are two types of point extensions, one that increases the dimension of the polytope and one that keeps it the same.
        A point-extension with point P that increases the dimension of the current polytope does not need a face parameter.
        Because the entirety of the current existing polytope will become one of the face of the extended polygon.
        An extension with the point P does not increase the dimension of the polytope if and only if P is in the affine space of the polytope.
        <br><br>
        If F is the original polygon and G is the polygon made from extending F to the point P with the face polygon K (which may only be F itself if P is not in the affine space of F),
        then it is defined the "extension polygon" of the extension to be a polygon E
        where $V \in E$ is true if and only if $\exists \lambda \in \mathbb{R}, R \in F$ such that $P + \lambda(R - P) = V$.
        <br><br>
        Now to define the steps to make a polygon. -->
        Definition 1. A point-dilation-extension of a set of vectors S onto the point P is the set 
        Definition 2. A 
        A polytope is a set of vectors in a certain vector space P under the field F which may be constructed
