        <h1>Schroder-Bernstein theorem</h1>
        This is a proof guided by an exercise in my analysis book.
        Here is the statement of the theorem: <br>
        <b>Schroder-Bernstein Theorem</b>: Suppose there exists a 1-1 function $f: X \to Y$ and another 1-1 function $g: Y \to X$, then there exists a bijective function $h: X \to Y$. <br>
        Here are the exercise questions provided by the book for guiding the proof of this theorem: <br>
        (a) Partition $X$ and $Y$ into two components 
        $$X = A \cup A' \quad \text{and} \quad Y = B \cup B'$$
        with $A \cap A' = \emptyset$ and $B \cap B' = \emptyset$ in such a way that $f$ maps $A$ onto $B$, and $g$ maps $B'$ onto $A$.
        Explain how achieving this would lead to a proof that $X ~ Y$. <br>
        (b) Set $A_1 = X \backslash g(Y)$ (what happens if $A_1 = \emptyset$?) and inductively define a sequence of sets by letting $A_{n+1} = f(g(A_n))$.
        Show that ${A_n : n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a pairwise disjoint collection of subsets of X, while ${f(A_n) : n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a similar collection in Y. <br>
        (c) Let $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}$ and $B = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}$. Show that $f$ maps $A$ onto $B$. <br>
        (d) Let $A' = X \backslash A$ and $B' = Y \backslash B$. Show that $G$ maps $B'$ onto $A'$. <br>
        <br>
        Now here's my attempt at answering all of those questions: <br>
        (a) Define the $h: X \to Y$ to be 
        $$h(x) = \begin{cases}
        f(x) & \text{if } x \in A \\
        g^{-1}(x) & \text{if } x \in A'
        \end{cases}$$
        And notice that since $g$ is bijective, then $g^{-1}$ is also bijective. Also that there is not going to be any conflicts because $A \cap A' = \emptyset$.
        Take any $y \in Y$, then since $B \cup B' = Y$, then $y \in B$ xor $y \in B'$.
        If $y \in B$, then $\exists! x \in A$ such that $f(x) = y$ because $f$ maps $A$ <i>onto</i> $B$ and $f$ is also 1-1 hence the exclamation mark denoting there exists only 1.
        If $y \in B'$, then $x = g(y)$ must exist, and by the injectivity of $g$, there is only 1 such $x$. Therefore $g^{-1}(x) = y$.
        Therefore it can be concluded that $h$ is surjective and injective because in both cases, we have argued why there exists only 1 $x$ for each $y \in Y$.
        <br><br>
        (b) Since $A_2 = g(f(A_1))$ and $A_1$ excludes any result of $g$, then $A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset$. 
        It will now be proven that if $A_1, ..., A_n$ with $n > 1$ is pairwise disjoint, then $A_1, ..., A_{n+1}$ is also pairwise disjoint by proving that each of $A_1, ..., A_{n}$ individually is disjoint with $A_{n + 1}$.
        $\forall m \in \{1, ..., n-1\}$, $A_m \cap A_n = \emptyset$. By the injectivity of $f$ and $g$ which keeps intersection relations, $g(f(A_m)) \cap g(f(A_n)) = \emptyset$.
        By the definition of $A_{n+1}$, that implies $A_{m + 1} \cap A_{n + 1} = \emptyset$ which means the entire statement now becomes
        $\forall m \in \{2, ..., n\}$, $A_m \cap A_{n} = \emptyset$. But we also know that $A_{n + 1}$ is the result of a call to $g$, and since $A_1$ excludes any result of $g$, then $A_1 \cap A_{n+1} = \emptyset$.
        Therefore we have proven that $A_{n+1}$ is always individually disjoint with each of $A_1, ..., A_n$. Since $A_1, ..., A_n$ is also already pairwise disjoint, then the resulting $A_1, ..., A_{n+1}$ is also pairwise disjoint.
        By induction, it can be conluded that $A_1, ..., A_n$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is always pairwise disjoint. 
        <br><br>
        (c) This is very trivial, take any $b \in B$, this means $\exists n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $b \in B_n$ which, by the definition of $B_n$, imply $b \in f(A_n)$ which implies that $\exists a \in A_n$ such that $f(a) = b$ which also means $a \in A$.
        So it can be concluded that $\forall b \in B$, $\exists a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$. We also know that, since for any $a \in A$, $\exists n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a \in A_n$, then $f(a) \in B_n$ by the definition of $B_n$. Therefore it can be concluded that $f$ maps $A$ onto $B$.
        <br><br>
        (d) Notice that since $A_1 = X \backslash g(Y)$ and $A_1 \subset A$, then $A' = X \backslash A \subset g(Y)$.
        Therefore $\forall a \in A'$, $\exists b \in Y$ such that $g(b) = a$.
        It will now be proven that $b$ must be in $B'$ because if it is not, $a$ must be in $A$.
        Suppose $b \in B$, then $\exists n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $b \in B_n$, and since $B_n = f(A_n)$ then $a \in A_n$ must be true by the injectivity of $f$ and so $a \in A$.
        Therefore when $a \in A'$, $b$ cannot be in $B$ and so it must be in $B'$.
        And for any $b \in B'$, $g(b) \in A'$ because it cannot be in $A$ since $A$ excludes any result of $g$.
